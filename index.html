    <p>In classical mechanics, Newton's laws of motion are three laws that describe the relationship
      between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. The first law states that an object
      either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity,
      unless it is acted upon by an external force. The second law states that the rate of change
      f momentum of an object is directly proportional to the force applied, or, for an object with
      constant mass, that the net force on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied
      by the acceleration. The third law states that when one object exerts a force on a second object,
      that second object exerts a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three laws of motion were first compiled by Isaac Newton in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
      Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687.
      Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems,
      which laid the foundation for Newtonian mechanics.
    </p>

    <h2>The First Law</h2>
    <p>The first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will
      stay in motion unless acted on by a net external force. Mathematically,
      this is equivalent to saying that if the net force on an object is zero,
      then the velocity of the object is constant.

      {\displaystyle \sum \mathbf {F} =0\;\Leftrightarrow \;{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=0.}\sum
      \mathbf {F} =0\;\Leftrightarrow \;{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=0.
      Newton's first law is often referred to as the law of inertia.

      Newton's first (and second) laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame.[4]</p>

    <h2>The Second Law</h2>
    <p>The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly
      proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.

      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac
      {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}
      Constant Mass
      For objects and systems with constant mass,[5][6][7] the second law can be re-stated in terms of an object's
      acceleration.

      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} (m\mathbf {v} )}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m\,{\frac {\,\mathrm {d} \mathbf
      {v} \,}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m\mathbf {a} ,}{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} (m\mathbf {v} )}{\mathrm
      {d}
      t}}=m\,{\frac {\,\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} \,}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m\mathbf {a} ,}
      where F is the net force applied, m is the mass of the body, and a is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force
      applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration.

      Variable-mass systems
      Main article: Variable-mass system
      Variable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases,
      are not closed and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;[6][7] The
      equation of motion for a body whose mass m varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by
      applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected or accreted
      mass;
      the result is[5]

      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {u} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} \over
      \mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {F} +\mathbf {u} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} \over
      \mathrm {d} t}
      where u is the exhaust velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can
      derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.

      Under some conventions, the quantity {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}}{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} {\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}} on the left-hand side, which represents the
      advection of momentum, is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket
      exhaust) and is included in the quantity F. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation
      becomes F = ma.
    </p>

    <h2>The Third Law</h2>
    <p>The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one
      object A exerts a force FA on a second object B, then B simultaneously exerts a force FB on A, and the two forces
      are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: FA = −FB.[8] The third law means that all forces are
      interactions between different bodies,[9][10] or different regions within one body, and thus that there is no such
      thing as a force that is not accompanied by an equal and opposite force. In some situations, the magnitude and
      direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body A; the force exerted by Body A
      on Body B is called the "action", and the force exerted by Body B on Body A is called the "reaction". This law is
      sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with FA called the "action" and FB the "reaction". In other
      situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary
      to identify one force as the "action" and the other as the "reaction". The action and the reaction are
      simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the action and which is called reaction; both forces are part
      of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.[8]

      The two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on
      an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires
      pushing backward on the road).

      From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the
      floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on
      the tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the
      water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and
      the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces
      depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the
      needed reaction force.[11]

      Newton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum;[12] from a deeper perspective, however,
      conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via Noether's theorem from Galilean invariance),
      and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when force fields as well as particles
      carry momentum, and in quantum mechanics.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that
      heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at
      rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state
      when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed
      continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. Galileo Galilei, however, realised that a force is
      necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity.
      In other words, Galileo stated that, in the absence of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The
      tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what Johannes Kepler had called inertia.) This insight was
      refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"—no force means no
      acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of
      inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.</p>
